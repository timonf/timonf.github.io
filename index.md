# Welcome

Hi there! My name is Timon and I'm a web developer located in Cologne. On these
pages you can see my projects and public profiles.

My main focus is targeted on _PHP_ and _Symfony_ applications. I'm also
interested in JavaScript and other stuff like this.

## Attended events

good way to meet me. You can find me also on many conferences as visitor:
